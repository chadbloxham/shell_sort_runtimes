## Purpose (see cs260Pproject1.pdf for more in-depth details)
Computes and displays the run time of the Shell sort algorithm using several different gap sequences. Computes average runtimes for randomly distributed unsorted arrays as well as almost sorted arrays. Sorts input arrays of various sizes.

## Run Instructions
Requires the modules Matplotlib, Numpy, Time, and os. Run Main.py.
